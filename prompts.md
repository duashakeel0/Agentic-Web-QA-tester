# Prompts Log

Running log of significant AI prompts used to build this project, per the internship's AI-coding-discipline requirement. Updated as work happens, not compiled after the fact.

## Day 1 — Repo Scaffold, Environment & Documentation Gate

**Prompt:** Scaffold a new full-stack project — React + TypeScript frontend (Vite) and Python FastAPI backend — for an AI agent that tests websites. Set up a mock end-to-end stub (backend returns a fake test-run result, frontend fetches and displays it) so the pipeline is proven before any real agent logic exists.

**What was generated:**
- `frontend/` — Vite + React + TS scaffold (`npm create vite@latest -- --template react-ts`), default template assets removed, `App.tsx` rewritten to fetch and display a mock test-run result from the backend
- `backend/app/main.py` — a FastAPI app with a `/api/health` check and a `/api/mock-run` endpoint returning a hardcoded fake result
- `README.md` — architecture diagram (Mermaid), tech stack, model-selection rationale, run instructions
- This file

**What was checked/modified before accepting:**
- Ran `npm run lint` (oxlint) on the frontend — clean pass
- Ran `tsc -b && npm run build` — compiles and builds cleanly
- Started both servers and used Playwright to actually load the page in a real browser and confirm the mock data renders correctly — not just assumed from the dev server logs
- Removed the default Vite template's demo content (counter button, logo images, "next steps" links) since none of it applies to this project
